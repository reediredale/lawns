Most smaller businesses don't think big enough, it's time to slow down and think about how you performed in the 2 main functions that matter, marketing and innovation.

I want you to write down how you performed in the categories, and how you could be better.

You have products, but you sell experiences and transformations for your customers. Be customer facing, and stop being so focused internally that you miss the purpose of your business altogether. Check NPS scores, see customer feedback and recent reviews and overall be accountable for your actions.

It's also the unfortunate time to not only do your taxes, but to cut the bottom 10% of annualised performing products and staff.
